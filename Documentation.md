# AI BASED COLOR MAPPING

## This code provides three kind of color mappers. 
- Gray Scale Converter using RGB Color scale
- Gray Scale Converter using LAB Color scale
- A modified CYCLE-GAN for content preservation

### Gray Scale Converter using RGB Color scale
 This model uses a ConvNet Architecture to map from gray scale images to color images. 
 
### Gray Scale Converter using LAB Color scale
This model uses a ConvNet Architecture to map from gray scale images to color images.

#### Training and Testing
We use our "main parser" to train and test this model as follows using the following parameters:
##### Training
- model_name base_gray
- train_or_test train
