### TODO

#### Parsing
- Add Parsing support for basic gray scale converting (ip-AC)
- Add parsing support for lab gray scale converting(ip-AC)
- Add parsing support for cycle-gan and run it (ip-AC)
- Add parser for preprocessing images for high resolution images

#### Modelling
- Port PyTorch code to Tensorflow. 
- Add metric for style and content evaluation.
- Label pixels for H&E And MUSE and FIBI images.
- Plot Loss curve for all 3 models to understand it better
- Communicate results with professor for evaluation.

#### Interface
- Build graphical interface 
- Set up API for model inference
- Test graphical interface.
