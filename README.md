# MachineChurning



### TODO

#### Parsing


- Add parser for preprocessing images for high resolution images
- Host data on bucket and add script to download it
- Testing gray Scale and lab_gray to make sure its working
- Testing Setting for cycle-gan, and refine it even better.

#### Modelling
- Port PyTorch code to Tensorflow. 
- Add metric for style and content evaluation.
- Label pixels for H&E And MUSE and FIBI images.
- Plot Loss curve for all 3 models to understand it better
- Communicate results with professor for evaluation.
- Modify with architecture to use U-Net to see if that makes a difference.

#### Interface
- Build graphical interface 
- Set up API for model inference
- Test graphical interface locally.
- Look at builiding pipelines to store data for training purposes later on.




### Done

#### Parsing
- Add Parsing support for basic gray scale converting (Done- AC)
- Add parsing support for lab gray scale converting(Done- AC)
- Add parsing support for cycle-gan and run it (ip-AC)
