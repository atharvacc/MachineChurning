if screens remains unloaded for >5 sec 
try "flask run --port=8001" or any port within 8000-8100 range
this most likely due browser refresh speed and ability to connect to port

if after a refresh the formatting ever off looks at all, there is lag in webpage rendering,
which should be seperate from functionality of app, ie uploads/model running should be fine. 
Formatting can be resolved by waiting >=5 sec and refreshing

If running app many consective times, browser will end up caching app locally to avoid 
constant reload of files, however it will miss any updates to image upload/processing status,
prss Cntl-Shift-R on Windows or Cmd-Shift-R to refresh browser cache.

At any time if it feels the app is behaving irregularly, restart the app from cmd line 
with "flask run" cmd.

Was mainly tested in Chrome/Firefox, any other browser support is not guaranteed
