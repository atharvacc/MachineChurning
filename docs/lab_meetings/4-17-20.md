### Summary
- Unsupervised Image Segmentation Technique
- Proposes a new loss function for unsupervised segmentation
- Post Processing methods ( Unclear, will update once i know more)
- Results are good on Berkeley segmentation challenge

#### Proposed Implementation
- Use segmentation as a saliency map within the cycle gan loss

## Discussion
- Issues with converting from los res to high res since the content might be scaled down so the segmentation loss proposed might not be the best option.
- Proposed a method of utilizing multiple Cycle-gan to classify different regions. Will help with capturing variance amongst different regions.
- Using a histogram based approach to do the conversion process on full image. (Check using results for low res and high res MUSE/FIBI to HE)
- Babysitting the cycle-gan by using a neural network to do the saliency map after training on manual labels.
- Proposed to look into developing different tests to understand the segmentation loss that Atharva presented
- Proposed to think of ways to refine the cycle-gan to only focus on thing, such as only changing the color or refining the image
